Cloud-J version 8.0c notes (May 30, 2023, Prather)
    After publication of CJ v8.0 code and examples, it was noted at Harvard (E. Lundgren, thank you)
    that the standalone driver incorrectly calculated the in-cloud Ice Water Path as
        IWP(L) = 1000.d0*WIC(L)*PDEL*G100 / CLF(L)    ! g/m2
    whereas it should be in parallel with the Liquid Water Path (as it was in Cloud-J v7.5 and earlier)
        IWP(L) = 1000.d0*WIC(L)*PDEL*G100    ! g/m2
    This is corrected in the new standalone driver CJ80c.f90.  This code also turn on clouds as average (CLDFLAG=2)

    Fortunately, all the test using CJ80.f90 were done with CLDFLAG=1 (clear sky) and thus the error did not matter.
    A new set of output files with CLDFLAG=2 (average clouds) without uv H2O absorption is now included.
    The basic differences between with and without xH2O are shown in the original output files for v80.

    (April 7, 2023, Prather)
Cloud-J 8.0 is designed for J-values, rather than for solar heating rates (Solar-J)
    although it does calculate heating rates for uv-vis using standard 18 wide-band wavelength
    bins of the traditional Fast-JX codes (~180-778 nm).

    Most of the parameters describing various Cloud-J options are set in
        1) the cmn block via file FJX_CMN_MOD.F90 (most of the dimension variables)
        2) the subroutine INIT_FJX via the file FJX_INIT_MOD.F90

    The spectral datasets are set for read-in length of SX_=27 super-bin used for the RRTMG Solar-J calculations.
    The current usage in terms of radiative transfer calculations is W_ = S_ = 18 (uv-vis, not near-ir)
    A lot of the Solar-J features have been removed or commented out.

    Version 8.0 has been cleaned up with a number of unused variables and parameters removed.
    Also the FJX_osa_mod.f90 (ocean surface albedo) has be updated to real*8 and cleaned.

    There is no Solar-J v8.0, any users wanting Solar-J+RRMTG will need ot merge the CJv8.0 with SJv7.6.
    If users want to run Solar-J based on the old LLNL or CLIRAD codes, those subroutines are still included
        but not activated.  Further, the wide-band spectral data sets would need to change to match the fewer
        number of near-ir super-bins, contact mprather@uci.edu.

    The current default is for pseudo-spherical refractive atmosphere and cloud quadrature atmospheres (CLDFLAG=7).
    The clouds have 6 vertical groupings (max overlap) that are 33% correlated with the blocks above/below.

    This v8.0 code has been tested for the "TROP-ONLY" option with a reduced number of wavelength bins and J-values.
        NWBIN (set in sub INIT_FJX) = 18 by default, but set to 8 or 12 it produces J-values good for
        tropospheric-only chemistry.  J-values with NWBIN=12 are within <1% of the standard code up to 20 km. (SZA=0 test)
        The NWBIN=8 is not quite so good, but the worst case is -1% error in J-O2 up to 17 km; and -3% by 20 km..

    The major reason for CJv8.0 is to include X_H2O cross sections for absorption only in uv-vis (290-350 nm)

    Revised CJ code to pass WWW = molec H2O/cm2 for each layer through to PHOTO_J

    IMPACT:  Reduces J(O1D) by 11% in tropics at the surface (cloud-free, SZA=0), 1/2 @ 3 km, 1/4 @ 6 km.

Cloud-J version 7.7 notes (Feb 2020, Prather)

Small cleanup from version 7.6 (see notes below)
    some typos and non-std characters removed

!    Variables in calling sequence expanded to get diagnostics out.
!   'fjx_cmn_mod.f90' modified slightly to include variables for running SJ w/LLNL & CLIRAD
!     v7.7  (02/2020) Final synch with Solar-J v7.7
!        Corrects problem with MAX-RAN that was caused by MAX-COR fixes
!        New calling sequence of FPs, added OD18
!   'cld_sub_mod.f90' for Cloud-J v7.7 (02/2020) - last change = fixes for MAXRAN
!---revised in v7.7 (02/2020) fixed MAX-RAN (#0 & #3) set CLDCOR=0 if need be
!      SUBROUTINE ICA_DIRECT -- not used, finally removed in v7.7

Cloud-J version v7.6c notes (Jul 2019, Prather)

The last published version of Cloud-J was v7.3c (see Prather, 2015 GMD)
Updates with minor fixes have been released: 7.3d, 7.3e, 7.4d, see

   ftp site:  ftp://128.200.14.8/public/prather/Fast-J_&_Cloud-J

Also see doi:
   Prather, Michael; Hsu, Juno (2019), Solar-J and Cloud-J models version 7.6c,
   Dryad, Dataset, https://doi.org/10.7280/D1096P

This new version 7.6c goes along with the publication of the paper:
    A round Earth for climate models, Prather & Hsu, PNAS, 2019.
Cloud-J and Solar-J have many overlapping data sets and subroutines,
    but Solar-J is more complex and has special needs.

Major updates, many described in the 2019 publication include:
    Spherical hydrostatic corrections for mass and geometry (new option)
    Corrected calc of deposition of direct beam (FLXD) so that scattered
        flux is now conserved to 2/e6, and the TOTAL incident is correct
    A refractive ray-tracing code SPHERE1R is available, and a new cleaner
         algorithm for SPHERE1N (straight rays) is included.  Also a
         flat-Earth version SPHERE1F is available.
    Major re-coding of the Feautrier lower boundary conditions to allow for
         angle-dependent albedos, specifically the ALBEDO is now specified
         for each wavelength at the 4 quad angles AND for the incident SZA.
    New Ocean Surface Albedo (OSA) module depends on angle, wind, chlorophyl
         based on Seferian++ code; XWRC corrected for <400 nm from 0 to 0.2
    New simpler way of interpolating TAU and F for inserted cloud layers
    Dropped adding mid-layer odd-points for J's to cut cost.
    All the data tables needed to iniitalize are in a subdirectory /tables

Three sample standalone drivers show: a range of solar zenith angles for
cloudy vs clear, the effect of stratospheric (including GeoMIP) aerosols,
and the range of different cloud-overlap parameterizations.

Note:  the ACLIM_FJX module in fjx_sub_mod.f90 had to be corrected for Solar-J
to do a smooth interpolation with latitude.  This corrected version is included
here as fjx_sub_mod-corr.f90. It should replace the original version, but
the standalone reference cases have NOT been redone, and the corrected
version shifts the atmospheric profiles in T and O3.
